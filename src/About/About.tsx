          <p>This Stock Trading Simulator is a simplified stock portfolio management system that replicates key investment functionalities to help users experiment with investing.
            I independently designed and coded every part of this project, from the UI layout to the backend logic, as a hands-on learning exercise to strengthen my understanding of the technologies used.
            All icons, logos, and visuals were also created by me. While it may not be perfect, I genuinely enjoyed building it and experimenting with new ideas throughout the process.
